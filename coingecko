Good news: CoinGecko datasource will soon be supported by qchartist

This idea to add this new data source came from the fact that i was not able to get the crypto chart of vault ai vaulta ausdt with the current available data sources of qchartist.
I was a bit fustrated that tradingview had this coin and even other new coins but not qchartist

Here are the python scripts in the attached zip file that will be used to get historical data and coin id list from the coingecko api.
You can already use them with your python interpreter and open the obtained csv in qchartist.

As you can see, i had to exclude the use of pandas and numpy modules in the scripts to avoid compatibility issues with python 3.8 w32
These modules crash when they are imported with the python distrib included with qchartist

To do so, i asked chatgpt to rewritte my python script without using pandas and numpy modules, the way the script functions exactly the same way.

to obtain a 1h chart: use python pcgeck.py with command line arguments --interval 5min --days 33 then use period converter of 12 in qchartist
to obtain a 4h chart : use python pcgeck.py with command line arguments --interval 15min --days 90 then use period converter of 16 in qchartist
to obtain a daily chart : use the obtained 4h chart and use period converter of 6 in qchartist

python pcoingecklist.py gets the list of all available symbols

All that will soon be implemented for easy use via the data source gui interface

Enjoy!
